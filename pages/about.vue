              Since the beginning of my journey as a frontend developer with
              design skills, Iâ€™ve built several products for all companies Iâ€™ve
              worked for, collaborated with talented people to create digital
              products for both business and consumer use. Iâ€™m quietly
              confident, avid learner, and positive thinkerer. I love to see
              tech conferences on youtube, learning new things about coding,
              love to travel with my wife to anywhere in the world. Have a nice
              dog and love to get out of home with my friends. I've been
              organizing freeCodeCamp meetups in Lisbon for the past years and I
              love to mentor new people to start their careers as software
              developers.
